# FinalProject

This repository contains my Spring 2020 final project for ECON 5253: Data Science for Economists, titled "Price of a Life: An Application of Value-Adjusted Utility Theory to Pharmaceutical Pricing Policies." The paper is an extension of my independent resarch project completed for ECON 5940: Research in Economic Problems (advised by Dr. Dan Hicks), which creates and advances the Value-Adjusted Utility Theory referenced in the title. The project contained in this repository inlcudes relevant information from the larger paper in the Literature Review (rather than presenting it here as a chapter of the larger project) to allow it to be a freestanding, self-contained paper. The analysis carried out here will appear as a chapter in the 5940 project, edited to remove redundancies. 

The original sources of data that were accessed for this project are included in [DATA SOURCES FOLDER]: They include:
- WAC
- GoodRX
- Mortality
- CDC NCHS
- NIH Clinical tests
- Macrotrends
- references.bib

The written report for this project is found in the "Final Product" folder, along with the code used to conduct the analysis. Running [CODE.R] will reproduce the processes taken to read in, clean, and analyze the data reported in this project. It includes labels to explain the processes being carried out in each step of the code. For ease of reference, the final datasets used to conduct the analysis are also provided in [CLEANED_DATA FOLDER]
